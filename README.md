This is the personal website of [Ian Li](http://www.ianli.com).

## Developing

This website is built using Jekyll.
This website uses Bundler to setup Jekyll.
If you don't have Jekyll setup, make sure that the correct gems are installed by running:

    bundle install

Once you have Jekyll, you can run the website locally:

    ./run_jekyll.sh

This is equivalent to running:

    bundle exec jekyll serve -P 4020
