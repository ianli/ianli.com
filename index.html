    <p>
      I've enjoyed making things since I was a kid.
      I turned everyday items into toys.
      A matchbox became a robot, scrapwood into a boomerang, a shampoo bottle into a hydroplane.
      As I've become older, the joy of making has remained with me, albeit with different materials.

    <p>
      When I was young, I was obsessed with comic books (Spider-Man being my absolute favorite). I wanted to be able to draw from imagination without "copying". I thought comic book artists drew that way and so must I. Over time, my interest in comic books waned, but I continued to draw. Over the years, I even learned to paint from real life.

      Ph.D.

    <p>
      I was a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute from 2004 to 2011. During that time, I worked on designing and developing tools that help people track and visualize information about their behavior. I eventually called this research area,
      <a href="http://www.personalinformatics.org">personal informatics</a>.
      My work was advised by the wisdom and support of my advisors
      <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anind/">Anind Dey</a> and
      <a href="http://jodiforlizzi.com/">Jodi Forlizzi</a>.

      The following is my dissertation and some of my major papers.
