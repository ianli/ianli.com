      I like making things. I like the process of turning an idea into reality whether itâ€™s on paper or on a computer. On this personal site, I share the various
      <a href="#projects">projects</a> and
      <a href="#drawings">drawings</a> that I've made, including my
      <a href="#phd">research and writings</a> during my Ph.D. Making things is also my daytime job as a UX designer/engineer at Google.

      I've always liked to make things since I was little. Growing up in the Philippines, I didn't have many toys, so I had to improvise by making them. A matchbox and cardboard turned into a robot, scrapwood into a boomerang, shampoo bottle into a hydroplane. The joy of making has remained with me as I've become older, albeit with different materials. Here are some samples of projects that I've worked on.

      When I was young, I was obsessed with comic books (Spider-Man being my absolute favorite). I wanted to be able to draw from imagination without "copying". I thought comic book artists drew that way and so must I. Over time, my interest in comic books waned, but I continued to draw. Over the years, I even learned to paint from real life.

    <p>
      I was a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute from 2004 to 2011. During that time, I worked on designing and developing tools that help people track and visualize information about their behavior. I eventually called this research area,
      <a href="http://www.personalinformatics.org">personal informatics</a>.
      My work was advised by the wisdom and support of my advisors
      <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anind/">Anind Dey</a> and
      <a href="http://jodiforlizzi.com/">Jodi Forlizzi</a>.

      The following is my dissertation and some of my major papers.
