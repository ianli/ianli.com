      I came across the beautiful infographic poster
      <a href="http://www.julianhansen.com/#/zimmer/">So You Need a Typeface</a>
      that was designed by <a href="http://www.julianhansen.com">Julian Hansen</a>.
      I thought it might be cool to make a version that is interactive, so I made this website.

      The website starts with the list of all the fonts from the poster.
      The first thing the user does is choose the kind of project the font is going to be used for,
      <i>e.g.</i>, a logo, an infographic, etc.
