      I worked on <a href="/projects/moodjam.html">the first version of MoodJam</a> at the end of 2006. I stopped working on MoodJam for a while because I was finishing my Ph.D. dissertation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2011, I attended <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Amsterdam-2011/">the Quantified Self Europe Conference in Amsterdam</a>. During one of the conference breakfasts, I met <a href="http://lauriefrick.com/">Laurie Frick</a> who makes wonderful art with self-tracking data. She told me about a new project that she was working on with colorful laminated tiles. She said the project was inspired by a website called MoodJam. Surprised and excited that I would meet a MoodJam user thousands of miles from my home town, I exclaimed "I made MoodJam." Inspired by this chance meeting, I prepared a new version of MoodJam, which I released on January 1, 2012.

      This version of MoodJam has a new home page and a new logo.
      Moods are now visualized as squares with bands of colors.

    <p>
      I also added a banner to make it easier for users to log in.

      Users can also describe the valence of their moods (positive vs. negative) in addition to adjectives, colors, and notes.

      I used the valence of moods to visualize how often certain colors are used for a month's worth of moods. Notice how warm colors were used more often for positive moods (valence &ge; 20), while cool colors were used more often for negative moods (valence &le; 20).
