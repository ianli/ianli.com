      LayerCake is a Javascript date picker that supports quick selection of year, month, and date.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most calendar pickers support selection of month and year together (<i>e.g.</i>, "April 2011"). This means that if "April 2011" is currently selected and the user wants "April 2012", the user has to click 11 times (a click for each subsequent month). With LayerCake, the user only has to click twice: (1) select the month, "April" and (2) select the year, "2012".
