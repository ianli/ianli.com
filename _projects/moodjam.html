      History
    </h2>

    <p>
      I created MoodJam in late 2006. Earlier that year, a bunch of HCII Ph.D. students and I discussed many ideas for mood-sharing projects. We didn't make anything, but these discussions seeded my interest in tools for sharing moods. Several months later, I visited the MIT Media Lab's web site and I really liked the colors at the top of the site. I thought <i>what if you record moods using strips of colors.</i>?
