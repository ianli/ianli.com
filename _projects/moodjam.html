      MoodJam is an online diary that allows people to express their moods using colors.
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked on MoodJam in late 2006. Earlier that year, a bunch of
      <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/phd">HCII Ph.D. students</a> and I discussed many ideas for mood-sharing projects. We didn't make anything, but these discussions seeded my interest in tools for sharing moods. Several months later, I stumbled upon the MIT Media Lab's web site and I really liked the colors and graphics of the web site. I thought <i>what if you record moods using strips of colors?</i>

      MoodJam has a form for users to post their moods.
      Users can visualize their moods by selecting several colors from a color palette.
      Users can associate these colors with words that describe their moods.
      People can also add a note to describe in more detail how they are feeling.

      In early 2007, Google promoted their
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/gadgets/?csw=1">Google Gadgets API</a> by running a contest. I created a Google Gadget called My MoodJam. My MoodJam received two Google Gadget Awards: (1) the <i>Prettiest gadget</i> and (2) the <i>Gadget most likely to get you a date</i>.
