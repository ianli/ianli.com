short: I wanted to create a drawing editor in Javascript that can be easily added to web pages. I found the Javascript vector graphics library, Raphael, and I thought it would be a good foundation for a drawing editor. The result is Raphael Sketchpad.

      I wanted to create a drawing editor in Javascript that can be easily added to web pages. I found the Javascript vector graphics library,
      <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>,
      and I thought it would be a good foundation for a drawing editor. The result is Raphael Sketchpad.

    <p>
      Drawings in Raphael Sketchpad are stored as JSON in an input field
      (<i>e.g.</i>, textarea, hidden, etc.) that can be submitted along with a form.
      Once submitted, Raphael Sketchpad can read the JSON data to render the drawing.
      This makes Raphael Sketchpad useful for web applications that need an editor for simple drawings.
